# Crop-yield-prediction
The data refers to district wise, crop wise, season wise and year wise data on crop covered area (Hectare) and production (Tonnes).
• The data is being used to study and analyse crop production, production contribution to district/State/country, Agro-climatic zone wise performance, and high yield production order for crops, crop growing pattern and diversification. 
•Created a web application that predicts crop yield production using machine learning algorithms.
